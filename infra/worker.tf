# `aws_lambda_function` cannot be created without a payload, and the real

# is that chicken-and-egg and nothing else: it is read once, at create, and
# then `ignore_changes` below means Terraform never looks at it again.
#
# It is deliberately not runnable. The `handler` string points into
# `evaluator_cog/`, which this archive does not contain, so an invocation
# that somehow arrives before the first deploy fails with an import error
# and the message is retried and then dead-lettered. That is the behaviour
# we want from an undeployed function.

# This used to be a stub worker under `infra/stub/` that logged its event,
# probed the API and returned success. Returning success is what made it
# dangerous — it consumed real jobs and discarded them, and an evaluation
# eaten that way is indistinguishable from one never enqueued. The things
# it was written to prove are proven (see "Verified" in README.md); they
# are properties of the account, not of a cog, so no later cog re-proves
# them. A placeholder that cannot succeed replaces it.
