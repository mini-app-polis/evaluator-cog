# api-kaianolevine-com, as a caller. The fleet's only producer, and its one
# long-lived credential.
#
# **This is a fleet-wide resource living in the first cog's state**, like
# the GitHub OIDC provider above it. Every cog after the first sets
# `create_api_producer = false` — there is one API, so there should be one
# identity for it. Create one per cog and by the fifth the API holds five
# access keys, five Doppler entries and five boto3 client configurations,
# all expressing "the API may send to the fleet's queues".
#
# The name says `evaluator` because renaming an IAM user destroys and
# recreates it, which would invalidate the key the API is using and stop
# every enqueue until a new one reached Doppler. Not worth an outage for a
# cosmetic fix; see the migration doc if it is ever worth doing
# deliberately.

# The account this is applied to, for the queue ARN pattern below. Read
# rather than configured, so the policy cannot name the wrong account.

  # The resource is a wildcard over `*-jobs` rather than a list of ARNs,
  # and that is deliberate. Every cog's queue is `<name_prefix>-jobs` in
  # this account, so one statement covers the fleet as it grows — no
  # cross-state reference from a cog's infra back to this policy, and no
  # step where adding a cog means remembering to widen a permission
  # somewhere else.
  #
  # What the wildcard gives up: a queue created later is writable by the
  # API without anyone deciding. That is the intended state — the API is
  # the only legitimate producer for any of them — and it is bounded by
  # the naming convention and by SendMessage being the only action. A
  # compromised key can cause work to happen; it cannot read a queue,
  # drain one, or forge the result of anything.
